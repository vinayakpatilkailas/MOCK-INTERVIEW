    <h2>Q-1 Difference between flex row and column ?</h2>
    <p> this mean flexbox can work  the item start from the start edge of the main axis . the items do not sketch on the main dimention ,but can shrink. the items will strech to fil the size of the cross axis
        if there one thing flexbox excels at, its twelve column in a twelve-column layout the page is broken into twelve invisible column  </p>
        <h2>Q-2 Explain inline, internal ,external stylesheets?</h2>
        <h3>inline stylesheet:</h3>
        <p>you can add inline css by using the style artibute of the html element this way is mostly used when we need to apply the style to one unique element </p>
        <h3>internal stylesheet: </h3>
        <p>the internal css is not the most preffered way but this way is used when we need to apply style for a single page. internal css layout added in head section </p>
        <h3>external stylesheet: </h3>
        <p>external css most preffered way to add css to website . first of all creat a separate ccs file with css extention  add this file head section of html page by using the link tag</p>
        <h2>Q-3 Justify-content allows you to do what ?  </h2>
        <p>the css justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container and inline axis of a grid container  </p>
        <h2>Q-4 Difference between absolute and relative possition ?</h2>
        <p> <h3>position: relative;</h3>
            An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
            
            Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position</p>
            <h3>Absolute possition:-</h3>
            <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

                However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
                
                Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
                </p>
                <h2>Q-5 What is grid templet column used to ?</h2>
                <p>The grid-template-columns property specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout.

                    The values are a space separated list, where each value specifies the size of the respective column.
                    
                    
                    </p>
                    <h2>Q-6 What is the z-index in css ?</h2>
                    <P>The z-index property is used to displace elements on the z-axis i.e in or out of the screen. It is used to define the order of elements if they overlap on each other.

                        Syntax:
                        
                        z-index: auto|number|initial|inherit;
                        Property values
                        </P>

                        <h2>Q-7What is the difference between padding and margin ?</h2>
                        <p>The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.
                            CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element:

                            padding-top
                            padding-right
                            padding-bottom
                            padding-left</p>
                            <h2>Q-8 What is box sizing ?</h2>
                            <p>The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

                                If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height:
                                
                                Both divs are the same size now!
                                
                                Hooray!
                                
                                Here is the same example as above, with box-sizing: border-box; added to both <div> elements:</p>
                                    <h2>Q-9 What is annimation -delay ?</h2>
                                    <p>n animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

                                        You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.
                                        
                                        To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
                                        
                                        Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
                                        
                                        The @keyframes Rule
                                        When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.
                                        
                                        To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.</p>
